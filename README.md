## Deep Dive: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

### What is RAG?

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an AI technique that combines a retrieval mechanism with a generative model. In the context of the GRC Management Application, RAG retrieves relevant documents or data snippets from a predefined corpus (like `grc-context.txt`) and uses them to augment the responses generated by a language model. This ensures that answers are not only contextually accurate but also grounded in the specific data of your organization.

### How RAG Enhances GRC

- **Contextual Accuracy**: Responses are tailored to your organization's policies and compliance data, reducing generic or irrelevant answers. This includes leveraging standards like PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) within the RAG corpus to ensure responses are aligned with specific security and compliance requirements for payment processing environments.
- **Efficiency**: Quickly retrieve and summarize complex regulatory information without manual searching.
- **Decision Support**: Provides actionable insights by correlating risk data with compliance requirements in real-time.
- **Learning Capability**: The system can be updated with new documents, ensuring the chatbot remains relevant as regulations evolve.

### Technical Implementation

The RAG system in this application is implemented via:

1. **Vector Store** (`lib/simple-vector-store.ts`, `lib/vector-store.ts`):
   - Documents are converted into vector embeddings for similarity search.
   - When a query is made, the system retrieves the most relevant document snippets based on cosine similarity.
2. **Context Loading** (`lib/load-summary.ts`):
   - Loads textual data from files like `grc-context.txt` into the vector store.
3. **API Integration** (`app/api/chatbot/action.ts`):
   - Exposes an endpoint for the chatbot UI to send queries and receive RAG-augmented responses.
   - Combines retrieved data with a generative AI model to craft human-readable answers.

**Code Snippet** (from `lib/simple-vector-store.ts`):
\`\`\`typescript
export class SimpleVectorStore {
  private vectors: { id: string; vector: number[]; content: string }[] = [];

  add(vector: number[], content: string, id: string) {
    this.vectors.push({ id, vector, content });
  }

  search(queryVector: number[], topK: number = 5): string[] {
    return this.vectors
      .map(v => ({
        content: v.content,
        similarity: cosineSimilarity(queryVector, v.vector)
      }))
      .sort((a, b) => b.similarity - a.similarity)
      .slice(0, topK)
      .map(result => result.content);
  }
}
\`\`\`

### Customizing RAG Context

To tailor the chatbot's knowledge base:
1. Update the context files with relevant GRC data, policies, or FAQs.
2. Rebuild the vector store by running the context loading script:
   \`\`\`bash
   pnpm run load-context
   \`\`\`
3. Test the chatbot with sample queries to ensure responses align with the updated data.
